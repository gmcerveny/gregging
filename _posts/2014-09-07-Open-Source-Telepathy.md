title: Brain to Brain with EEG and TMS

When I first read this:

> Using EEG, the researchers translated the greetings "hola" and "ciao" into binary, and then emailed the results from India to France. At this receiving location, a CBI transmitted the message to the receivers' brains through noninvasive brain stimulation. This was experienced as phosphenes â€” flashes of light in their peripheral vision.

I thought, wait a minute, magnets aimed at my brain can produce a feeling of lights in my peripheral vision?

Apparently there is an open source project so you can [DIY](http://open-rtms.sourceforge.net/about.html). And if you want an EEG for the transmission end, there's [that too](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html).
