title: Gareth Loy's Musimathics - Mathematic Foundations of Music
---

I picked up these books recently, Gareth Loy's [Musimathics volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262516551/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262516551&linkCode=as2&tag=gregcerveny-20&linkId=6JZFUZAYNZZZSBLA) and [volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026251656X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=026251656X&linkCode=as2&tag=gregcerveny-20&linkId=4P5RIAS3YKN7W5ZQ), and I was pleased to discover they are delightfully written.

Here's a few things I like so far.

## Musimathics: volume 1

From the preface:

> Since engineering is basically about applying human values to nature, readers will discover a lot about themselves, about the world of sound and music, and about what human cultures have valued. However, because I approach these values from an abstract perspective, they can be seen objectively, giving a better vantage point from which readers can make their own choices.

## Musimathics: volume 1

From the forward by John Chowning talking about the musicians and engineers at SAIL:

> An implicit understanding within this community of individual users went something like this: Any question asked would be cheerfully and completely answered, to any level of detail... _once!_ It was assumed that the questioner would then make the effort to follow up and fully comprehend the answer and all its implications before returning with another question.  

From the preface:

> I believe that enlightened common sense and inference are the whole of mathematics and that inference itself flows from enlightened common sense.

And a wonderful quote that opens the first chapter on sampling digital signals:

> The gods confound the man who first found out how to distinguish the hours! Confound him, too who in this place set up a sundial, to cut and hack my days so wretchedly into small portions!  
  ~ Plautus

I feel compelled to mention the beautiful design and lovely feeling paper. 

Thanks to my virtual classmates in [audio signal processing](https://www.coursera.org/course/audio) for recommending it.
