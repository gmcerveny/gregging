The CCRMA summer workshop on New Music Controllers was awesome. This was my first opportunity to visit the computer music department at Stanford, and it's like a temple dedicated all the things I love.

A few high points I took away from the course:

* Practice contemplating designs, including interactions, feedback, and sound generation
  * [Physical Interaction Design for Music](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a/index.html)
  * [The Design of Everyday Things](http://amzn.com/0465067107)
  * Focus on the end performance
  * Optionally, what does the instrument want to do
* Get a foundation in electronics
  * [Make Electronics](http://amzn.com/0596153740)
  * [Electronics Playgrounds](http://www.elenco.com/search/searchdetails/130-in-1_electronics_playground=MjA0)
* Build Quickly with Max
  * [STK](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/), and the derivative [PeRColate](http://www.music.columbia.edu/percolate/) max patches.
  * Use max for things max is good at
  * Use arduino for things C is good at
* Programming Arduino 
  * [Stino](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino): Arduino Sublime Plugin
  * [Multi-tasking and Arduino: Why and How?](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~gurevich/Feijs_ArduinoMultitasking.pdf): State programming for interactions
* Cool Events
  * [NIME](http://www.nime.org)
  * [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com)
* Other Cool People, Groups, and Things
  * [CNMAT](http://cnmat.berkeley.edu): Berkley's Computer Music Department
    * [Max Depot](http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/library/max_msp_jitter_depot)
  * [Rob Ives](http://www.robives.com): Paper kinetics
  * [Ajay Kapu](http://www.ajaykapur.com): Installations, Instruments, and Research
  * [Trimpin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimpin)

In addition to sharing the basics of building interactive musical devices, this workshop was also a way to see what some cool folks are into. I'll definitely be thinking more about what I learned that week.
