title: CCRMA New Music Controllers
---

I'm pretty stoked to be registered for this CCRMA summer workshop:

[New Music Controllers](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/new-music-controllers) w/ Sasha Leitman and Michael Gurevich.

>  In this workshop, you will learn how to construct novel musical controllers and sound art objects. Alongside physical interaction design, the workshop integrates programming, electronics, audio, and interactive music. Participants will learn how to use some of the basic tools of Maker community, including the Arduino platform, sensor technologies, communication with MIDI and Open Sound Control (OSC), and physical interface design.
