title: Interleaving C Study
---

I've been brushing up on my C lately.  I started with Zed Shaw's Learn C The Hard Way.  But after picking up some new [learning tips](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning), I've revisited my schedule a bit to alternate my short sessions between:

* [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org) - Zed Shaw
* [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com) - Daniel Holden
* [The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/The-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628) - Kernighan & Ritchie

I'm super stoked tinkering with Holden's material.
